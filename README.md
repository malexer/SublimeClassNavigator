# Class Navigator

Class Navigator helps to quickly go to class defenition in a current file.

It is using "Goto Symbol..." with some additional filtering.

Currently specific class detection is done for Python source only. All other
sources will be trying to detect first-level items.

Feel free to add more accurate class detection for other source types - check
the `FILTERS` dict in the `ClassNavigator.py`.
